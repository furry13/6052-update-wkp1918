Abstract

   This document removes the requirement in Section 3.1 of RFC6052 that
   the NAT64 Well-Known Prefix 64:FF9B::/96 MUST NOT be used to
   represent non-global IPv4 addresses, such as those defined in
   [RFC1918] or listed in Section 3 of [RFC5735].

1.  Introduction

   Section 3.1 of [RFC6052] prohibits IPv4/IPv6 translators from using
   the Well-Known Prefix (WKP, 64:FF9B::/96) to represent non-global
   IPv4 addresses, such as those defined in [RFC1918] or listed in
   Section 3 of [RFC5735].

   This restriction is relatively straightforward to implement in DNS64
   [RFC6147]: a DNS64 server simply avoids synthesizing an AAAA record
   using the WKP if the original A record contains a non-global IPv4
   address.  However, this requirement introduces significant
   operational challenges for systems that do not rely on DNS64 and
   instead use local synthesis such as CLAT (Customer-side Translator,
   [RFC6877]), or similar approaches.

   Enterprise and other closed networks often require IPv6-only nodes to
   communicate with both internal (e.g., using RFC1918 addresses) and
   external (Internet) IPv4-only destinations.  The restriction in
   Section 3.1 of RFC6052 prevents such networks from utilizing the WKP
   and, consequently, from relying on public DNS64 servers.

   Using two NAT64 prefixes — the WKP for Internet destinations and a
   Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) for non-global IPv4 addresses — is not
   a feasible solution for nodes performing local synthesis or running
   CLAT.  None of the widely deployed NAT64 Prefix Discovery mechanisms
   ([RFC7050], [RFC8781]) provide a method to map a specific NAT64
   prefix to a subset of IPv4 addresses for which it should be used.

   According to Section 3 of [RFC7050], a node must use all learned
   prefixes when performing local IPv6 address synthesis.  Consequently,
   if a node discovers both the WKP and the NSP, it will use both
   prefixes to represent global IPv4 addresses.  This duplication
   significantly complicates security policies, troubleshooting, and
   other operational aspects of the network.

   Prohibiting the WKP from representing non-global IPv4 addresses
   offers no substantial benefit to IPv6-only or IPv6-mostly
   deployments.  Simultaneously, it substantially complicates network
   design and the behavior of nodes.

   Given the recent operational experience in deploying IPv6-only and
   IPv6-mostly networks, it is desirable to allow translators to use a
   single prefix (including the WKP) to represent all IPv4 addresses,
   regardless of their global or non-global status.  This simplification
   would greatly improve the utility of the WKP in enterprise networks.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   This document reuses the Terminology section of [RFC6052].

3.  RFC6052 Update

   This document updates Section 3.1 of [RFC6052] ("Restrictions on the
   Use of the Well-Known Prefix") as follows:

   OLD TEXT:

   ===

   The Well-Known Prefix MUST NOT be used to represent non-global IPv4
   addresses, such as those defined in [RFC1918] or listed in Section 3
   of [RFC5735].  Address translators MUST NOT translate packets in
   which an address is composed of the Well-Known Prefix and a non-
   global IPv4 address; they MUST drop these packets.

   ===

   NEW TEXT:

   ===

   The Well-Known Prefix MAY be used to represent non-global IPv4
   addresses, such as those defined in [RFC1918] or listed in Section 3
   of [RFC5735].  Address translators MUST translate packets in which an
   address is composed of the Well-Known Prefix and a non- global IPv4
   address; they MUST NOT drop these packets.
